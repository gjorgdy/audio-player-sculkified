This server side Fabric mod enables uploading custom audio for music discs, goat horns and note blocks with heads.

This mod requires [Simple Voice Chat](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-voice-chat) on the client and
server.

Besides all the existing features of [Audio-Player](https://github.com/henkelmax/audio-player), this fork adds 'sculk speakers'.

## Sculk Speakers

If a jukebox has a *Sculk Shrieker* on top of it, it will enter 'transmit' mode.
Any Note Blocks with a *Sculk Sensor* on top of them in range (16 blocks by default), act like speakers.
They will be connected to the jukebox and will all play the same audio.

## Amethyst Repeaters

To be able to place speakers further than 16 blocks away, the signal can be retransmitted with *Amethyst*.
Either use a *Calibrated Sculk Sensor* instead of a normal *Sculk Sensor* on top of a Note Block.
Or place a normal *Sculk Sensor* on top of an *Amethyst Block*.
